# BitcoinPriceLSTM
This is my course project for [Introduction to Deep Learning](http://dl.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/) at CUHK.

- Built a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), combined with Google Trends for keywords related to Bitcoin and commonly used financial indicators
- Prediction Accuracy Outperforms traditional prediction models such as ARIMA and LSTM without Google Trends and financial indicator features
