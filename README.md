# BitcoinPriceLSTM
This study intends to predict Bitcoin price using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network, combined with Google Trend
for keywords related to Bitcoin and commonly used financial indicators. It also compares the performance of the
proposed model with other models, including LSTM with
Google Trend but without financial indicators, LSTM without Google Trend and financial indicators, as well as traditional financial forecasting methods like the ARIMA model.
The results show that combining Google Trend would increase the predicting accuracy significantly. However, integrating the financial indicators into the model does not influence the model performance much, and may even impose
a negative effect on predicting accuracy.
